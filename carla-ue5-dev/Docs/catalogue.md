# CARLA catalogue

The CARLA simulator provides a vast library of 3D assets to populate your autonomous agent's virtual environment. The 3D asset library provides numerous pre-built maps to choose from, a diverse array of vehicle models for traffic simulation along with models of pedestrians and other structures or obstacles that can be dynamically added to your simulation during runtime. This catalogue documents all of the 3D assets available to use in your simulations. 

* [__Vehicles catalogue__](catalogue_vehicles.md)
* [__Pedestrians catalogue__](catalogue_pedestrians.md)
* [__Props catalogue__](catalogue_props.md)

## Maps

There are two maps to chose from. An urban environment with skyscrapers, commercial units, industrial units and residential streets and an off-road, open-cast mine environment.

| Town       | Summary |
| -----------| ------  |
| [__Town10__](map_town10.md) | A downtown urban environment with skyscrapers, residential buildings and an ocean promenade.|
| [__Mine__](map_mine.md) | An industrial, off-road, open-cast mining environment. |

!!! note
    Towns 1-9 are included in the build-from-source version of CARLA but are not updated or tested to work with UE5. There may be non-functioning geometry or textures in these maps. If you choose to use these maps, you will likely need to fix problems in the maps before use. 

## Vehicles

CARLA provides a diverse array of vehicles, with high fidelity models of real world cars, trucks and bikes, for replicating traffic in your simulations. Browse and choose the vehicles you like in the [__vehicle catalogue__](catalogue_vehicles.md).

## Pedestrians

CARLA's asset library includes a variety of pedestrians to simulate foot traffic in the 3D environments surrounding your agent. Browse and choose the pedestrians you want in the [__pedestrian catalogue__](catalogue_pedestrians.md).

## Props

CARLA's props model the various structures and items you might find on or near roads, such as kiosks, statues, benches, boxes, bins, debris or trash. The props can be placed anywhere in your simulation dynamically during runtime. Browse and choose your props in the [__props catalogue__](catalogue_props.md).
