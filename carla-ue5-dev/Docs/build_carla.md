# Building CARLA from source

!!! note
    This build documentation refers to building the Unreal Engine 5 version of CARLA.

Users can build CARLA from source code for development purposes. This is recommended if you want to add extra features or capabilities to CARLA or if you want to use the Unreal Editor to create assets or manipulate maps. 

Build instructions are available for both Linux and Windows. You can also build CARLA in a Docker container for deployment in AWS, Azure or Google cloud services. Visit the [__CARLA GitHub__](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) and clone the repository. 

The Unreal Engine 5 version of CARLA requires a minimum of Windows 10 or Ubuntu 22.04.
